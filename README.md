## SGBusRouter

![SGBusRouter iPad App](sgbusrouter-ipad-app.jpg)

This iPad app is a conceptual port of cheeaun's [busrouter-sg](https://github.com/cheeaun/busrouter-sg). Like its original version, it basically show all available routes on the map for all bus services in Singapore. Credits to [@cheeaun](https://github.com/cheeaun)!

The app used to be in the AppStore for a while up until mid 2015 when my app develope program expired. The Xcode project is in this repository and the bus data is outdated.
