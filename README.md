### SGBusRouter

![SGBusRouter iPad App](sgbusrouter-ipad-app.jpg)

This iPad app is an iOS port of [@cheeaun](https://github.com/cheeaun)'s [busrouter-sg](https://github.com/cheeaun/busrouter-sg). It basically shows all routes on the map for all bus services in Singapore. Credits to [@cheeaun](https://github.com/cheeaun)!

The app used to be in the AppStore for a while until 2015 when my App Developer Program expires. The source code is in this repository and the bus data is outdated.
